Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic approach that involves the application of engineering principles and methods to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate software systems. 
the importance of software engineering include but not limited to:
- development of systems that are scalable
- it provides a structured and well deatled method to develop softwares
- it ensures that softwares are highly reliable and consistent

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The WaterFall Model: this is the first model that detailed the life cycle of a software 
- The Open source Milestone: this is the milestone or era that began or gave birth to open source softwares that are freely available for anyone to use, modify and also distribute
- The cloud computing milestone: this milestone allowed softwares to be hosted and delivered via the cloud 

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning: the is the phase where every details about the software as required by the client is discussed and planned
- Design : this is the phase that focuses on defining the software architecture and design based on the requirements.
- Implementation (Coding): this is the phase where the actual coding of the software takes place.
- Testing: During this phase, the developed software is rigorously tested to identify  errors, bugs and issues that can hamper the smooth running of the software.
- Deployment: this is the phase where the developed software is made available to end users for use.
- Maintenance and Support: In this phase, the software is  constantly monitored for issues and bugs.  

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- waterfall nethodology is linear and sequential while agile is iterative and incremental.
- water fall has rigid phases while agile methodology has flexible phases
- water fall has fixed requirements from the beginning of the software development while Agile embraces different requirements as they evolve

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer: designs, codes and implement a software application based on the requirement of the project
- Quality Assurance Engineer: is responsible for ensuring that the software developed by the software engineer meets quality standards and works as expected
- Projec Manager: is responsible for overseeing the software development project from inception to completion and ensures that the developed software meets the project requirement

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDE provides the software developer the environment (like editor, compiler, debugger, build automation tools etc) to build / code and develop the software application eg visual studio code, sublime
- Version Control Systems: are systems that help software teams to mnage changes to source code over time. eg git, github, mercurial
  
7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Ambigous requirements: to overcome this challenge, regular stakeholder engagement should be carried out and agile methodology should be adopted. also the clients or software requirements should be documented and the parties involved should be aware of waht was documented
-  Integration Issues: to overcome this challenge, continuous integration tools should be employed to automate the integration process
- Keeping up with technology: the developer should continuously learn and keep himself updated with the recent technology that pertains to software development

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing: Unit testing involves testing individual components of a software application in isolation to verify that each part functions correctly.
- Integration Testing: Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between integrated components or systems to ensure they work together as intended.
- System testing: System testing is a type of testing that assesses the system's compliance with functional and non-functional requirements.
- Acceptance testing: Acceptance testing is the final testing phase before the software is delivered to the end users. It determines whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
 
1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering refers to the process of designing, optimizing and carefully crafting the input (prompt) given to an AI model to ensure that the output meets the user's needs and expectations.
IMPORTANCE:
- It helps users to maximize the the performance of an AI model like ChatGPT
- It improves users experience and interaction with AI
- it reduces cognitive load on  AI 
- it mitigates bias and misinterpretation 

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about the major event that happened in the United States yesterday
clear prompt: Tell me about the major event that happened at the white house yesterday
